# Quize_App_repo
This is technical quiz app similar in many application(Amazon, flipkart, mintra) like "Play and Win", "Give answers and win exciting prices".
User has to signup using his emailID and create password, which i had store after encrypting it using "sha1" algorithm. And used jwt for authorization.
Quiz contain 10 question where each question has 4 options and out of them only 1 correct option and each question has a timer of 10 seconds. If you give more than 5 correct answers then you will win some exciting offers.
Finally there is leaderboard where you can check your position with respect to other participants.
I have used HTML, CSS, Javascript, ReactJs, NodeJs, ExpressJs, MongoDB.
